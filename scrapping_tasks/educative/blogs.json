Time-slicing, prioritizing tasks, and constant decision making have the potential to adversely affect one's productivity. Outside of office hours too there is so much that needs to be done-important tasks which compete for time with activities of personal interest. To top it off, we need to carefully navigate through distractions in our daily lives. In all of this, effective time management becomes a key skill that we need to master. \n\nIn this blog, we focus on the importance of time management and make a case for it by showing the economic and social costs of not doing so efficiently. We then discuss techniques that have been proposed to become better at managing this most precious resource.",

This method is based on human visual system insights, exploiting our greater sensitivity to luminance than color. By transforming images to the YCbCr color space, the resolution of the color component can be reduced without significantly compromising perceived quality. The 4:2:0 subsampling technique is explained, which saves half the space required to store or transmit an image. The JPEG standard employs 4:2:0 chroma subsampling as part of its lossy compression algorithm. Other subsampling formats, like 4:4:4, 4:2:2, and 4:1:1, are also mentioned. The blog emphasizes the practical use and importance of chroma subsampling in various image and video compression standards.",

Stack memory is managed using a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure and is automatically maintained by the system. It's ideal for temporary storage, local variables, function arguments, and control information. On the other hand, heap memory is a dynamic memory allocation method that the programmer must manage manually. It's best suited for large data structures, objects with dynamic lifespans, and data that persists beyond a single function call. Choosing between stack and heap memory depends on the specific requirements of your application and the desired performance and resource utilization.",
